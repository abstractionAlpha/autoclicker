# Auto Clicker
A simple Python auto clicker. Run it in your terminal using Python 3, and it will click the mouse for you every so often.

By default, the delay between clicks is 0.75 seconds, but this can be changed by opening the auto clicker in TextEdit or your preferred editor and changing the value of the *delay* variable. Make sure you make start.sh runnable before attempting to use.

Version history unknown or lost.
